# Production split runtime

This directory is the deployer-owned source for the production Message Server,
Agent, PostgreSQL, runner, TURN, and edge topology. Application repositories
publish their own formal image tags; this runtime deploys and updates those
immutable version references.

`compose.yaml` defines the application topology,
`compose.production.yaml` fixes production resources and restart behavior, and
`edge-compose.yaml` owns the canonical Caddy edge project.

The host lifecycle is intentionally small:

- `provision-local.sh` renders a fresh root-owned production receipt and
  protected environment. The GCP adapter records the Cloud Worker decision as
  `disabled` and omits the AWS-only host-region setting from Agent config.
  Despite the retained installed filename, it accepts only
  `DIREXTALK_SPLIT_COMPOSE_MODE=production`.
- `start-local.sh` establishes Message Server health first, records its full
  immutable container ID, and uses `refresh-message-mcp-token.sh` to extract
  only the stable portal `agent_token` from that exact container. The value is
  atomically published to the protected host secret source and materialized as
  Agent-owned mode-0400 `/run/secrets/message_mcp_token`; it never enters YAML,
  `.env`, argv, or logs. Startup then runs the explicit Agent
  init/migrate/runner path. If token extraction fails while Message Server is
  healthy, the wrapper materializes but does not start the receipt-bound Agent
  services and returns status `3`; Edge and messaging stay available for the
  Agent-only resume. `cleanup-local.sh` and
  `cleanup-provision-failure.sh` clean only receipt-bound resources.
- `update-message-server-local.sh` and `update-agent-local.sh` apply exact
  `vX.Y.Z` targets and restore the receipt-bound original image after failure.
  Agent update success, interrupted recovery, and rollback preserve and
  repeatedly revalidate the exact Message Server container; they never resolve
  a replacement by Compose name or recreate it. Before an Agent update starts
  or recreates the three long-running Agent services, it refreshes protected
  config material, migrates, stops the exact receipt-bound trio, and reruns
  runner cgroup preparation. A digest-bound config transaction restores and
  rematerializes the exact previous YAML with the old image on rollback or an
  interrupted retry.
  Agent-only update reuses the stable protected MCP token. Receipt-bound
  recovery refreshes it from the exact healthy Message Server before re-running
  `agent-secret-init`; neither path reads a mutable Message Server name or
  recreates Message Server.
- `stop-agent-local.sh` and `restart-agent-local.sh` provide the updater's
  fixed Agent recovery boundary. `prepare-agent-start-local.sh` provides the
  stop-and-prepare half for update flows; restart repairs and revalidates
  delegated cgroup ownership before starting extension runner, Core runner,
  and Agent. If a restart of an originally healthy trio fails during cgroup
  preparation or startup, it re-prepares and restores that exact trio.
- The remaining helpers materialize protected configuration, prepare runner
  isolation and the small Ubuntu host dependency set, verify formal images,
  and export the portal bootstrap receipt.

The Rust deployer renders these files into a deterministic signed runtime
archive under the installed path `deploy/split-agent`. `SOURCE_REVISION` is the
release source revision and `SOURCE_FILES.sha256` binds every bundled file.
Target hosts never clone Message Server, Agent, updater, or deployer source.

Operational tests live in `tests/split-runtime`; they are not packaged into the
server runtime bundle.
